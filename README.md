# ApacheSystemML
The purpose of this repository is to process data, prepare it, and build models to predict certain activities using ML techniques. The entire process leverages PySpark for distributed data processing . I included some personal notes from Advanced Machine Learning Signal Processing and Applied AI with deeplearning courses from IBM and other BigData courses.
