### PCA -  Principal component analysis 
1) Centre the data: compute the covariance matrix and then find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix
2) The eigenvectors become the principal components
3) The eigenvalues provide the explained variance
4) Select new dimensions and project the data
