#### Bayesian Inference

A method of inference where the probability of a hypothesis is updated as new evidence becomes available:

1) begin with a prior distribution process p(H) - prior 
2) collect data to obtain the observerd distribution p(E) - marginal likehood
3) calculate the likelihood - how compatible is the evidence with the hypothesis p(E|H) 
4) obtain the posterior - the probability of our hypothesis given the observed evidence  p(H|E)

Computing the posterior 
P(H|E)  =  P(E|H) * P(H)/P(E)
