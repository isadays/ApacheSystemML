Large Language Models (LLMs) can boost business impact across all use cases and sectors â€” translating text into other languages, enhancing customer experience with chatbots and AI assistants, organizing and classifying customer feedback for the right departments, summarizing large documents such as earnings calls and legal documents, creating new marketing content, and generating software code from natural language. They can even power other models, such as those that make art. Some popular LLMs include the GPT model family (e.g., ChatGPT), BERT, T5, and BLOOM.
